/*

TypeScript is a superset of a programming language called JavaScript
This means that any valid JavaScript is also valid TypeScript (although
  this is not recommended and errors by default)
TypeScript, however, adds "types"
These, tell the "TypeScript Compiler" ("tsc") and IDE's such as Visual
  Studio Code (VSC) the types of variables
This allows for "type checking", where your tools make sure that the code
  you write is type compatible

For example, if you had a function that takes a number as an argument and
  you try to give it a string, TypeScript will give you an error before
  you even try to run the code!
This is very useful because it detects and avoids bugs before "runtime",
  so they are easier to find and fix

Some basic types include:
  * Number
  * String (an array of characters like a word or sentence)
  * Boolean ('true' or 'false')
  * undefined
